# Interactive Waste Collection Management System with SQL and Python
I developed an interactive menu system using SQL and Python to manage waste collection operations akin to Pittsburgh's waste management system. This system enables users to perform various tasks such as employee management, truck assignment, route planning, and dumping center management. Users can add, edit, or remove employees, assign them to trucks, and track the number of employees in each truck, along with their destinations and departure times. Route planning functionality optimizes routes based on factors like traffic and distance. Additionally, the system manages dumping center information, including locations, capacities, and accepted waste types, while tracking dumping activities such as time and amount of waste dumped. Furthermore, users can generate reports and analyze waste collection data to gain insights into operations. Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in SQL and Python programming and my ability to design and implement an interactive menu system for efficiently managing complex waste collection operations.
